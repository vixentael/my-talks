---- | --- |

This talk is useful for people that believe that perfect crypto lib is a C lib with 1-page readme :)

Maintaining cross-platform cryptographic library is a journey full of unexpected bugs, language-specific hacks, difficult decisions and endless struggle to make developer-facing APIs easy-to-use and hard-to-misuse.

How to simplify complex crypto concepts into simple "encrypt(msg, key)" and "decrypt(data, key)" functions? How to provide unified API for 11 languages, when some of them are strongly-typed and another one is javascript? Secure by default: what design choices should be made to protect from misuse. Multi-platformness: how to make sure that message encrypted using Ruby on x64 Ubuntu 18.04 will be [successfully] decrypted on iOS12 on iPhone armv7s? Testing wildness: static analyzers, fuzzing, unit tests, integration tests. Docs: developers copy-paste from readme anyway, how to make sure that they copy-paste correct things.

I'll describe the 4yrs experience on maintaining multi-platform open source library Themis: from API design to language-specific hacks.

The real case about one large note taking the app, that decided to implement convenient note encryption and note locking for their existing user base. But finding a balance between usability, security and mobile platforms' restrictions is complicated.

We will start with the security design scheme, then select the proper encryption library, then implement the flow, and prepare for incidents. Now ‚Äî think about it ‚Äî cryptography is only chapter 3 in OWASP MASVS (8 chapters in general). Even the best cryptography will fail if basic security controls are badly implemented.

Points we will go through: the difference between "locking" and "encrypting", the difference between password and encryption key, how to sync passwords between devices, what exactly to store in keychain/keystore, how to use proper cryptography (AES CBC or AES GCM, random salt? IV? padding? what a hell is this mess), how to use biometrics (we don‚Äôt want to bother user, let‚Äôs use biometric keychain, but what if users will change their fingerprints ‚Äî shall we invalidate all passwords?), updating encryption version (imagine, vulnerability is discovered in our library or app ‚Äî how to update cipher, and softly migrate users to the new cipher, if users don‚Äôt even have a clue that encryption was versioned).

At the end, this is only one simple JIRA ticket "let's encrypt the notes" from the eyes of security software engineer :)

## "Defense in depth": trench warfare principles for building secure distributed applications

\#security \#software-architecture \#app-sec

[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/vixentael/defense-in-depth-trench-warfare-principles-for-building-secure-distributed-applications) | [video (en)](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/13782-defense-in-depth-trench-warfare-principles-for-building-secure-distributed-applications)| [video (ru)](https://youtu.be/hoj444FrCUo) | [blog post](https://www.cossacklabs.com/blog/defense-in-depth-with-acra.html) |
---- | --- | --- | --- |

It comes to no surprise, that any micro-services, any security controls you use to build applications ‚Äì will eventually be broken (or fail). Under certain pressure, some components will fail together. 

The question is ‚Äì how do we build our systems in a way that security incidents won't happen even if some components fail. And the data leaks won't occur even if attacks are successful.

"Defense in depth" is a security engineering pattern, that suggests building an independent set of security controls aimed at mitigating more risks even if the attacker crosses the outer perimeter. During the talk, we will model threats and risks for the modern distributed application, and improve it by building multiple lines of defence. We will overview high-level patterns and exact tools from the security engineering world and explain them to the modern web devs ;)

We will take a deep look into data lifecycle, risk, trust and how they affect security architecture, encryption, and key management techniques. We will illustrate typical SDL patterns: narrowing trust, monitoring intrusions, zero knowledge architectures, distributing trust. The goal of the talk is to give general thinking framework and enough ideas about tools for senior engineers to plan their solutions securely, regarding sensitive data contained within.

**Plan:**

üí´ modern apps are multi-components, most data leaks are caused by poor architectural decisions,</br> 
üí´ what is sensitive data life-cycle, </br>
üí´ how to build trust model for your app, </br>
üí´ what are typical trust patterns, </br>
üí´ how to select proper security controls based on real-world risks.</br>

---- | --- |

<img src="pics/making_security_usable.jpg" alt="Making Security Usable: Product Engineer Perspective" style="height: 466;"/>

This is a story of going through typical security challenges: how to build products that reliably deliver security guarantees, avoid typical pitfalls, and are usable in a predictable fashion by real users. It's a tale of balancing religious adherence to security practices with keeping customer's needs in mind at all time inside the development team; listening to the customers and observing actual behavior outside in the wild; and trying to make the best decisions to empower customers with easy tools for encrypting data in their apps securely and without pain.   

We'll take a look at the process through the eyes of one of our customers, who made all the things wrong before doing things right, and through the eyes of product engineer, responsible for learning the lessons to make security products even more usable and reliable for non-security-focused engineers. 

**Key takeaways:**

Attendees will go through several stages of inception and implementation of database encryption/intrusion detection tools. They will see the "behind the scenes" work inside a cryptographic engineering company, will see how customers are one of the most useful people to learn from, and how getting over "we tell you what to do" mentality makes security tools better.

## Zero Knowledge Architecture Approach for Mobile Developers [workshop] üõ†

\#security \#workshop \#mobile \#cryptography \#symm-encryption \#asymm-encryption

[github repo](https://github.com/vixentael/zka-example)
---- |

Zero knowledge algorithms and protocols ensure that no keys, passwords, files, or any other sensitive material ever gets transferred in an unencrypted or reversible form. There is no point in time when encryption keys or unencrypted files are visible to the servers or service administrators.

We took simple iOS application (Firebase notes app) and implemented two encryption schemes to illustrate how easy it is to protect data even for apps that use BaaS.

Plan:
 1. Learn about ZKA
 2. Familiarize with Firebase notes application
 3. Protect own notes (E2EE)
 4. Share notes to other users
 5. Improve security in general
(protect keys, improve login flow, hide screenshots, obfuscate code etc)

Before we get deep into protocols vulnerabilities: things you should remember designing your app flow from a security point of view.

This talk will focus on copybook headings of infosec: what you need to know before exciting stuff like cryptography and AI-assisted incident detection. Like, choice of data you show in the background mode, choice of 3rd party SDKs, which logs we send and where...

Even when developers create apps with security in minds, protect user secrets, and don‚Äôt reveal unencrypted data, attackers can find ways to bypass these security measures by exploiting architectural weaknesses and unobvious, yet very simple vulnerabilities. We will talk about all the tiny bits and pieces are necessary to make your app secure against simple attacks way before focusing on the hard things (like crypto).

1. Handling user secrets with care (showing, storing, logging).
2. Input validation and password rules.
3. Handling transport connection.
4. And some tips and tricks that will confuse attackers.

Crypto in our lives: why you shouldn‚Äôt spend time learning all the details of the crypto-algorithms. Typical mistakes you make using crypto in your products. How to avoid late night commits, but to code 'fast and boring' instead.

1. The typical engineering workflow "we should protect the data, what shall we do", and possible mistakes. 
2. What is "boring crypto", what do we want from using crypto-products. 
3. Possible solutions: HSM / TPM / software crypto. 
4. How to select appropriate software crypto: libs, systems, containers. 
5. We want crypto to be similar to the Edison lamp: controllable and boring system.

The security engineer's job is to choose the appropriate solutions for the problems and to apply them. Discussing blockchain regarding cryptography is rather boring: it is simple, and even some assumptions in high-level protocols do not cause protests.

I will talk about the other side - where blockchain looks like an optimal strategy, where it causes questions. We will walk through the risk&threats models, trust, and guarantees, to the experience of using blockchain in the real project (and what happened next).

We will talk about building security, that does not fail when application keys are exposed; when servers are hacked; security that lasts as long as unique user's crypto keys (or passwords) are safe. Putting secrets known by the user to be a source of trust is the ultimate way for an app to become "thin" in relation to the security model, thus lowering the risks and developer pain. We will learn about thin transparent security layers system and its applicability in client-server systems.

Everyone is talking about developers' specialization. 'Know you niche'. We have separate conferences for every dev area now: mobile, cloud, big data, iOT. In order to build a modern multiplatform mobile app you need to work with separate iOS and Android dev teams, separate backend dev team, designers and managers. Doesn't look too much?
 
I'll talk about another way of organization: multiskilled dev team, experience and benefits.

<img src="pics/upgrading_preview.jpg" alt="Upgrading approaches" style="height: 466;"/>

Mobile platforms present both new threats and new opportunities for system security. This presentation deals with modern approaches: how to protect data, which trust relationships emerge with mobile phone, how they affect traditional security layouts. How mobile phones dictate important client-server relationships.

But, what‚Äôs more important, we talk about making these things a consistent system: how to think to pick the right tools, which architectural patterns enforce security and minimize risks by design. We learn about ideas of echelonized defence, compartmentation and risk control. We finish with understanding where we stand right now: in security landscape that is rapidly changing, and mobile‚Äôs role in it is both dangerous and very important.

As the developer, I don‚Äôt want to be frustrated when I need to convert designs into assets.

We will talk about: 

* lots of tools and ways how to save own time 
* how to communicate with designer, and 
* if it‚Äôs okay to change designs on our own
